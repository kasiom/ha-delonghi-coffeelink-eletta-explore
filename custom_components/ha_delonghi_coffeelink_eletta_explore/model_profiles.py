"""Per-model behaviour profiles for De'Longhi Coffee Link – Eletta Explore machines.

Different machine families speak slightly different dialects of the same Ayla
protocol. Rather than scatter ``if oem_model == ...`` checks across the codebase,
each family's differences live in one small class here:

- which binary command property it uses (informational; the coordinator still
  auto-detects the live one from a candidate list);
- whether commands are **synthesized** (PrimaDonna Soul) or **learned from the
  official app and replayed** (Eletta Explore and, by default, any unknown
  model - replay works for any machine once taught);
- how a beverage / wake command value is produced.

To add first-class support for a new model, add a ``ModelProfile`` subclass with
its ``matches()`` rule and (if it needs the learn-and-replay path) set
``learns_from_app = True``. Nothing else in the integration has to change.
