# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes are documented here. The project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and uses the principles of
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add an account-wide Ayla DSS cloud stream for near-real-time datapoint and
  datapoint-ack updates, with immediate automatic fallback to polling.
- Add exact command confirmation by matching the device acknowledgement to the
  datapoint created by Home Assistant; an explicit device rejection is reported
  separately from a timeout.
- Add a disabled-by-default Wi-Fi signal diagnostic sensor when the vendor cloud
  exposes connection information for the machine.
- Add Coffee Link-equivalent aggregate counters for hot and cold milk drinks.
- Add explicit Coffee Link statistics families for Eletta/Striker Cold Brew and
  the legacy PrimaDonna Soul branch; unknown models never inherit an aggregate
  formula merely from their command channel.

### Changed

- Protect cloud-push state from duplicate, out-of-order and older MonitorV2
  events; retain a five-minute reconciliation poll while streaming and restore
  the normal 30-second interval whenever the stream is unavailable.
- Declare the integration as `cloud_push` and keep polling as a transparent
  reliability fallback.
- Match Coffee Link's Eletta statistics formulas for black coffee and Mug to Go,
  while retaining the established Home Assistant entity unique IDs.
- Correct `d553_water_tot_qty` from half-millilitre ticks to litres; preserve
  the vendor value's three-decimal precision instead of the app's whole-litre
  display truncation.
- Create a fresh, short-lived DSS subscription for every WebSocket connection,
  matching Coffee Link 4.9.6 instead of reusing a stale server stream key.
- Record the privacy-safe ACK status on the Last Command Status entity when DSS
  matches the acknowledgement to the exact datapoint issued by Home Assistant.
- Match Coffee Link's legacy statistics formula: `d700` is the black-coffee
  total, while `d701 + d703` is the hot-milk aggregate. Remove the misleading
  water-dispense interpretation of `d703`; total water remains sourced from
  `d553` and converted to litres.
- Keep semantic summary and maintenance statistics enabled for new entity
  registrations, while making per-recipe and recipe-group counters available
  but disabled by default. Existing Home Assistant entity-registry choices are
  not changed.
- Display the backward-compatible Coffee Link session state `ha` as the neutral
  **Active** / **Aktivní**. The machine-derived identifier is
  shared with the official app and therefore cannot prove which client holds it.

### Security

- Never retain or expose the DSS stream key or Wi-Fi network name. Diagnostics
  include only sanitized stream health, connectivity type and optional RSSI.

### Documentation

- Update the technical audit and English/Czech project status after publication
  of 1.2.1, its verified HACS installation and submission to the default HACS
  catalog review queue.
- Distinguish the installed 1.2.1 release from the 1.2.0 supervised physical
  command-acceptance baseline; 1.2.1 does not change those runtime paths.
- Record the current external HACS catalog check state without presenting it as
  an integration or release-validation failure.
- Record beta.4's backed-up target-HA deployment, clean restart, read-only
  statistics synchronization, loaded English/Czech resources and DSS event
  acceptance without claiming a physical command test.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-08-19

### Changed

- Prepare the repository for public distribution with stable HACS-first and
  manual installation guidance in English and Czech, a one-click My Home
  Assistant link and a documented maintainer release process.
- Trigger validation automatically when the repository changes from private to
  public, while retaining the public-only guard required by the HACS validator.
- Align custom-integration localization with current Home Assistant guidance:
  `translations/en.json` and `translations/cs.json` are the complete runtime
  sources and the unused core-build `strings.json` duplicate is removed.
- Update compatibility, security and technical-audit statements to reflect the
  completed 1.2.0 physical acceptance and cleaned Git history.

### Security

- Add a stable private-vulnerability-reporting path and a safe non-sensitive
  fallback contact procedure.
- Add repository tests that reject pre-publication wording, obsolete releases,
  duplicate translation sources and unpinned workflow actions.
- Keep 100% line and branch coverage with 312 isolated tests, including local
  Markdown-link validation for the public documentation set.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Add real-runtime integration tests against Home Assistant 2026.8.2 for the
  config flow, setup, platforms, entity/device registries, diagnostics and
  unload lifecycle.
- Add automatic account-device reconciliation: newly added or removed coffee
  makers trigger one controlled config-entry reload, and stale entity/device
  registry records are removed.
- Add translated Home Assistant Repairs guidance for saved learned commands
  that fail integrity or device-signature validation; the issue clears after
  all discarded commands are learned again.
- Add `icons.json` for every translated entity and action, and a tracked Home
  Assistant integration quality-scale checklist.

### Changed

- Prepare version 1.2.0 and align the code with current Home Assistant 2026.8
  interfaces: `ConfigFlowResult`, typed `ConfigEntry.runtime_data`, an explicit
  coordinator config entry, config-entry-owned background tasks and shared
  entity metadata.
- Declare `PARALLEL_UPDATES = 0` on every coordinator-backed platform and keep
  outbound commands serialized per coffee maker.
- Update documentation, installation guidance, compatibility statements,
  troubleshooting and the technical audit for the 1.2.0 release candidate.
- Pin every GitHub Action to a reviewed full commit SHA and pin CI runners to
  Ubuntu 24.04.

### Security and privacy

- Restrict the administrator raw action to CRC-valid beverage and wake/standby
  frames, require the learned signature of the selected Eletta machine and run
  the normal readiness, water-tank and grounds-container checks for raw starts.
- Remove account/device identifiers and upstream response bodies from routine
  cloud logging, and keep retry detail at debug level to avoid log flooding.
- Replace device signatures in current test fixtures with deterministic
  synthetic bytes and keep the raw-action schema free of an executable example.

### Tests

- Keep 100% line and branch coverage across all 17 Python modules: 311 isolated
  tests covering 2,050 statements and 628 branches.
- Run an additional CI job against the actual Home Assistant 2026.8.2 test
  interfaces on Python 3.14.2.

## [1.1.26] - 2026-08-19

- Reach 100% line and branch coverage for the coordinator and therefore for all
  16 Python modules in the integration.
- Cover polling and metadata refresh, monitor stability, cloud-session ownership
  and confirmation, command acknowledgement, recipe learning and persistence,
  app-traffic attribution, power commands, raw commands, delayed refreshes, and
  all translated error paths with deterministic local doubles.
- Simplify a redundant active-beverage check after a Stop frame has already met
  the same-beverage predicate; runtime behavior is unchanged.
- Raise the CI coverage floor from 83% to 100%; the full suite now contains 305
  tests with 100% overall line and branch coverage.

## 1.1.25 - 2026-08-19

- Reach 100% line and branch coverage for the Gigya/Ayla cloud client without
  contacting a real account or external service.
- Cover authentication locking, token validity and refresh, Gigya login and
  signed JWT exchange, Ayla SSO, credential rejection, transient HTTP errors,
  rate-limit delays, timeouts, malformed responses, and retry exhaustion.
- Cover device and property discovery, property writes, resilient reads, and
  the signed Coffee Link cloud-session payload, including response validation
  and fallback behavior.
- Raise the CI coverage floor from 74% to 83%; the full suite now contains 248
  tests with 83.09% overall branch coverage.

## 1.1.24 - 2026-08-19

- Reach 100% line and branch coverage for the configuration flow and integration
  lifecycle modules.
- Cover initial forms, successful account creation, all authentication and cloud
  validation outcomes, empty accounts, reauthentication, and reconfiguration.
- Cover service registration and execution, target-resolution failures, setup
  authentication and cloud errors, multi-device initialization, partial-failure
  cleanup, platform forwarding, and successful or rejected unloads.
- Raise the CI coverage floor from 70% to 74%; the full suite now contains 223
  tests with 74.83% overall branch coverage.

## 1.1.23 - 2026-08-19

- Reach 100% line and branch coverage for the sensor, binary-sensor, button,
  and binary command-builder modules.
- Cover entity setup and omission rules, counter metadata and parser routing,
  maintenance alarm variants, device-info fallbacks, button migration and
  dynamic learned recipes, action availability, and coordinator calls.
- Add protocol boundary coverage for malformed persistence, short and
  inconsistent frames, power-header validation, Coffee Link session refresh,
  wake validation, and unsigned Eletta frames.
- Raise the CI coverage floor from 60% to 70%; the full suite now contains 215
  tests with 71.48% overall branch coverage.

## 1.1.22 - 2026-08-19

- Reach 100% line and branch coverage for the firmware, localized-error,
  model-profile, MonitorV2, counter-parsing, and button-migration modules.
- Add regression cases for malformed object-shaped counter data, water-volume
  conversion, undersized monitor packets, empty migration candidates, the base
  model profile, and translated authentication errors.
- Remove an unreachable JSON type check and raise the CI coverage floor from
  40% to 60%; the full suite now contains 193 tests with 61% overall branch
  coverage.

## 1.1.21 - 2026-08-19

- Remove obsolete Eletta command synthesis and structural-frame diagnostics;
  Eletta Explore continues to validate and replay commands learned from the
  official Coffee Link app.
- Stop retaining unused decoded app-command and machine-response snapshots while
  preserving recipe learning, response confirmation, and privacy-safe diagnostics.
- Remove the unused semantic firmware parser; Home Assistant continues to show
  the complete appliance software string reported by the machine.
- Add direct regression coverage for sensor, binary-sensor, and button behavior,
  and keep local review dependencies out of distributable source.

## 1.1.20 - 2026-08-19

- Remove the obsolete `idle` translations again and purge the pre-1.1.18 Last
  Command Status history during the live migration. Future command transitions
  remain recorded normally.

## 1.1.19 - 2026-08-19

- Restore English and Czech translations for the legacy `idle` state so older
  Recorder history displays **No command** / **Žádný příkaz** instead of the raw
  value. The current runtime still starts as unknown and cannot emit `idle`.

## 1.1.18 - 2026-08-19

- Rename **Last Command Result** / **Výsledek posledního příkazu** to the more
  accurate **Last Command Status** / **Stav posledního příkazu** in synchronized
  English and Czech translations.
- Report the command status as unknown after a Home Assistant restart until HA
  actually issues a command, instead of claiming that no command occurred.
- Keep command history meaningful by publishing each transaction transition and
  adding privacy-safe start/completion times and command metadata.
- Prevent Coffee Link app-sniffer data from being mixed into the HA command
  sensor; captured app frames remain available only in diagnostics.

## 1.1.17 - 2026-08-19

- Replace the cloud-status enum with Home Assistant's standard connectivity
  binary sensor, shown as **Cloud Connection** / **Připojení ke cloudu**.
- Rename the exclusive command-session diagnostic to **Coffee Link Session** /
  **Relace Coffee Link** with explicit holder states.
- Remove the ambiguous last-connected timestamp and the cloud-update and
  statistics-sync timestamp entities, including their translations and legacy
  entity-registry entries.
- Stop persisting the removed statistics-sync timestamp; the synchronization
  action itself remains available.

## 1.1.16 - 2026-08-19

- Interpret MonitorV2 byte 6 as an operation-local step instead of a global
  action code, preventing non-milk recipes such as Cold Brew from being shown
  as milk preparation.
- Show status 7 with a non-zero step as the neutral "Preparing beverage" /
  "Připravuje nápoj" state while preserving exact status 10 milk preparation.
- Require status 7 with step 0 before starting a new beverage and retain raw
  status, step, progress, accessory, switch and alarm codes in diagnostics.
- Remove model-dependent water-level and high-alarm interpretations from the
  water-tank entity while retaining verified empty/missing indications.
- Keep English source strings and English/Czech translations synchronized.

## 1.1.15 - 2026-08-18

- Show only the complete appliance firmware identifier in Home Assistant's
  built-in Firmware field, without redundant `SW`/`FW` prefixes.
- Keep the complete ADA connectivity-module firmware separately available in
  privacy-safe diagnostics.

## 1.1.14 - 2026-08-18

- Replace language-specific Device information prefixes with neutral `SW` and
  `FW` labels while retaining both complete manufacturer identifiers.
- Add complete English and Czech translations for all user-visible command and
  service errors.
- Translate dynamically discovered recipe buttons via a placeholder instead of
  exposing a hard-coded English fallback.
- Extend localization regression tests to cover exception keys, runtime entity
  translation keys, and hard-coded Czech text outside `cs.json`.

## 1.1.13 - 2026-08-18

- Label the two complete embedded-software identifiers by component
  ("Coffee maker" and "Connectivity module") instead of implying an
  undocumented firmware-versus-software distinction.

## 1.1.12 - 2026-08-18

- Show both complete software identifiers in the single non-entity Device
  information firmware field, explicitly labelled as appliance software and
  connectivity-module firmware.
- Keep the two source values separately available in diagnostics.

## 1.1.11 - 2026-08-18

- Use the complete appliance `software_version` property as the Home Assistant
  device firmware value instead of Ayla's connectivity-module version.
- Remove the duplicate Software Version sensor; the value is now a non-entity
  fact in Device information and therefore has no click-through or history.
- Keep Ayla/ESP firmware available under an explicit connectivity-module key in
  the privacy-safe diagnostics export.

## 1.1.10 - 2026-08-18

- Present De'Longhi's verbose Eletta build identifier as the concise firmware
  version (`1.1.0`) while safely retaining unknown future formats.
- Exclude the target Home Assistant entity from Recorder so it remains a
  current diagnostic value without unnecessary state history.

## 1.1.9 - 2026-08-18

- Present `d512_percentage_to_deca` as the remaining maintenance interval:
  a raw 21% consumed value is now shown as 79% remaining.
- Rename the entity to "Remaining Until Descale" / "Do odvápnění zbývá" while
  keeping its stable entity identity and the raw alarm threshold unchanged.

## 1.1.8 - 2026-08-18

- Convert Eletta's zero-based `d556_water_hardness` cloud value (0-3) to
  De'Longhi's user-facing levels 1-4, matching the machine display and Coffee
  Link application.
- Reject out-of-range hardness values instead of presenting a misleading
  setting.

## 1.1.7 - 2026-08-18

- Remove the undocumented `d551_cnt_coffee_fondi` raw value from both the
  sensor platform and the waste-container attributes. Its unit and semantics
  are not published, so exposing it as a count was misleading and caused an
  unusable value to be recorded.
- Keep the manufacturer-provided grounds-container percentage and the
  full/missing alarm as the supported user-facing states.

## 1.1.6 - 2026-08-18

- Persist the successful manual statistics-synchronization timestamp in the
  integration's local Home Assistant Store and restore it after restart.
- Keep the existing "Synchronizace statistik" name and retain `unknown` until
  the first successful manual synchronization.

## 1.1.5 - 2026-08-18

- Rename the visible cloud-session states from "Home Assistant" / "Another
  application" to the technically accurate "Active session" / "Other session".
- Keep the existing enum keys for compatibility with entity history and user
  automations; update Czech labels to "Aktivní relace" / "Jiná relace".

## 1.1.4 - 2026-08-18

- Allow up to 20 seconds for beverage acknowledgement after live testing showed
  valid Eletta cloud transitions can arrive after ten seconds.
- Preserve the active beverage after a proven cloud write with late
  acknowledgement, keeping a learned Stop control available as a safety path.

## 1.1.3 - 2026-08-18

- Allow up to 30 seconds for wake and standby acknowledgement while retaining
  the shorter confirmation window for beverage commands.
- Prevent a successful but slower Eletta wake transition from being reported as
  a false command timeout.

## 1.1.2 - 2026-08-18

- Give every beverage button a stable unique ID based on the immutable numeric
  beverage identifier instead of its display or translation key.
- Automatically merge legacy aliases for the same beverage while preserving the
  established entity ID, preventing unavailable duplicates such as Cold Brew.

## 1.1.1 - 2026-08-18

- Accept signed Eletta recipe frames that legitimately omit the optional
  `01 0A` recipe trailer, preserving learned Cappuccino and Cold Brew commands.
- Keep the complete recipe payload when decoding a signed trailerless frame.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-08-18

### Added

- Standalone project identity, original branding and HACS metadata.
- Czech terminology reviewed against Home Assistant naming conventions.
- Filter, descaling, grounds-fill and cloud-session diagnostics.
- Strict validation of learned Eletta command frames.
- Professional documentation, issue forms and validation workflows.

### Changed

- Temporary Gigya/Ayla failures no longer trigger a false credential reauth.
- Cloud authentication is serialized to prevent concurrent login races.
- The data-update timestamp and recipe diagnostic button are disabled by default.
- Recipe diagnostics now log the reported recipe datapoint values, not only names.
- Known learned Cold Brew recipes use translated entity names.

### Fixed

- Water hardness and descale status are no longer classified as cumulative totals.
- Beverage start fails safely when the Eletta monitor state cannot be verified.
- Invalid CRC, recipe identity or device-signature frames are discarded.
- Raw protocol commands require a supported frame type and a valid checksum.
- Czech service selector now uses `Káva` consistently.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-08-18

- Initial standalone version derived from substantially modified MIT-licensed
  Coffee Link integration work.
