# Cloud snapshot refresh

## Why it exists

Ayla stores the most recently published appliance properties. Polling or DSS can
read and accelerate changes in that cloud copy, but neither mechanism alone asks
the coffee maker to publish a new statistics snapshot. Coffee Link 4.9.6 sends an
idempotent `03 02` appliance request while its foreground session is active.

The integration uses the same request cooperatively on validated Eletta
cloud-session profiles. This prevents counters such as filter usage and filtered
water volume from depending on a later launch of the mobile app.

## Lifecycle

- The first automatic request is scheduled 30 seconds after startup.
- A successful request is repeated at most once per hour.
- A completed beverage command schedules another request when the machine is no
  longer preparing.
- A skipped or failed automatic request is eligible for retry after five minutes.
- The integration checks the live `app_id` before claiming a session. It does not
  take over a visibly foreign session and does not maintain Coffee Link's
  foreground 140-second keepalive loop.

The request is not a wake or beverage command. It is deferred while the coffee
maker is offline, is preparing a drink, or another Home Assistant command is in
progress. Unsupported or unsigned model profiles continue to use read-only cloud
reconciliation without receiving this Eletta-specific frame.

## Verification

After sending the request, the integration waits up to ten seconds for a `d5*` or
`d7*` DSS property event and then performs an authoritative full-property read.
It compares a private digest of counter values and cloud update timestamps. The
digest, property values, device identifier and command frame are never included
in diagnostics.

Downloadable diagnostics expose only:

- attempt and success counts;
- last attempt/success UTC times;
- trigger (`automatic`, `post_command` or `manual`);
- result (`completed_updated`, `completed_unchanged`, `completed_unverified`,
  `skipped_*` or `failed*`);
- an exact DSS ACK status when the device property declares ACK support.

These are runtime diagnostics, not Home Assistant entities, and therefore do not
create recorder history. Automatic refresh also does not change **Last Command
Status**, which remains reserved for appliance commands explicitly issued by a
Home Assistant user or automation.

## Manual diagnostic button

**Refresh cloud data** uses the same implementation and is disabled by default.
Enable it temporarily only when diagnosing stale values. A completed unchanged
result is valid when the coffee maker republishes the same values; it does not by
itself indicate a fault.
