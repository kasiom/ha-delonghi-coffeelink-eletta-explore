# Usage and safety

## Data updates

After an initial cloud read, the integration receives near-real-time Ayla DSS
updates and performs a full reconciliation poll every five minutes. If the stream
is unavailable or silent, the integration immediately resumes 30-second polling
and reconnects in the background. The **Synchronize Data** button acquires a safe
Coffee Link cloud session, waits for the machine to publish fresh values and then
refreshes the coordinator. Counter changes can still be delayed by the machine or
vendor cloud.

The Coffee Link account device list is checked every ten minutes. A membership
change schedules one config-entry reload so newly added machines appear and
removed machines do not leave stale devices or entities behind.

## Entities

- **Cloud Connection** is Home Assistant's standard connectivity binary sensor.
- **Machine Status** reports the verified MonitorV2 state and keeps raw status,
  step, progress, accessory and alarm values in attributes for diagnostics.
- **Coffee Link Session** reports whether the exclusive command session is free,
  active under the machine's shared Coffee Link identifier or uses a different
  application identifier. The shared identifier cannot distinguish Home Assistant
  from the official app.
- **Last Command Status** tracks only commands issued by Home Assistant:
  pending, sent, acknowledged, timed out or rejected.
- Beverage and maintenance sensors expose current counters and percentages with
  appropriate units and state classes.
- **Wi-Fi Signal Strength** is a disabled-by-default diagnostic sensor. It appears
  only when the vendor cloud supplies RSSI; the Wi-Fi network name is discarded.
- Water tank, grounds container, descaling and filter binary sensors use the
  Home Assistant problem device class, so their normal state is shown as OK.

Diagnostic or developer-only entities, such as **Dump Recipe Datapoints**, can be
disabled by default and enabled from the entity registry when required.

## Controls

- **Wake** requests a transition from standby.
- **Standby** requests the same state as the physical power control.
- **Synchronize Data** requests a fresh session and cloud-property refresh.
- **Stop** is available only while the active beverage and its validated Stop
  command are known.
- Beverage buttons replay a validated command learned from Coffee Link.

A greyed-out button is normally an intentional safety state, not a failed entity.

## Learning a recipe

Prepare the recipe once in the official Coffee Link app while Home Assistant is
running. The integration observes, validates and stores the exact frame, then
dynamically adds a button. DSS normally delivers it immediately; during polling
fallback, multiple app commands between two reads can still hide an intermediate
command, so repeat the recipe if needed.

If a command restored from Home Assistant storage no longer passes integrity or
device-signature validation, the integration discards it and creates an item in
**Settings → System → Repairs**. The item explains how to reproduce the affected
commands in Coffee Link and disappears automatically after all of them have been
learned again.

Eletta Explore controls also require a device signature learned from a valid app
frame. Wake, standby and synchronization remain unavailable until that signature
is known.

## Actions

The integration registers `start_beverage`, `stop_beverage` and the
administrator-only `send_raw_command` action. Normal automations should use the
entity buttons or beverage actions. The raw action is intended only for controlled
protocol diagnostics and rejects malformed, unsupported or checksum-invalid
frames. It also enforces the current coffee maker's learned device signature,
accepts only beverage and wake/standby frames, and applies the same readiness,
water-tank and grounds-container checks as the normal beverage actions.

## Automation examples

The following non-dispensing example reports a sustained cloud outage. Replace
the entity and notification target with those from your Home Assistant instance:

```yaml
alias: Coffee maker cloud unavailable
triggers:
  - trigger: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.eletta_explore_cloud_connection
    to: "off"
    for: "00:05:00"
actions:
  - action: notify.mobile_app_phone
    data:
      message: Coffee Link has been unavailable for five minutes.
mode: single
```

For preparation, prefer a visible Home Assistant button that the user presses
only after checking the cup and accessory. A script can call the integration
action explicitly:

```yaml
sequence:
  - action: ha_delonghi_coffeelink_eletta_explore.start_beverage
    target:
      device_id: YOUR_COFFEE_MAKER_DEVICE_ID
    data:
      beverage: espresso
```

Do not attach preparation to presence, schedules or other unattended triggers.

## Safety rules

- Never start a drink without checking the cup, outlet and required accessory.
- Do not use remote preparation around children, animals or unattended equipment.
- Treat an unavailable control or a rejected pre-brew check as a safety decision.
- Do not bypass safety checks with raw commands.
- The integration cannot confirm every physical condition, including cup
  placement.
